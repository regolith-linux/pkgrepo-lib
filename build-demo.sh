# This is a demo script to show how package generation can be implemented to produce Regolith packages for some 
# packaging system.  As-is, these scripts are used to generate Debian packages and repositories using the debian packaging
# tools.
# 
# Each script must define the following variables:
# 
# PACKAGE_MODEL_FILE: fully qualified path to the package model file.
# BUILD_DIR: fully qualified path to a temporary build directory with write permissions.
# PACKAGE_FILTER: (Optional) inclusive filter on the name of the package.
# 
# Each script must define the following functions:
# handle_package() : This function is called to handle each source package that passes the filter.

# Input parameter handling
